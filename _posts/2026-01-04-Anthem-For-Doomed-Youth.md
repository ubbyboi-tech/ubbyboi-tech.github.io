**Wilfred Owen** is widely regarded as one of the most important poets of the First World War. Born in 1893, his early work showed conventional Romantic influences, but his experience as a soldier transformed his voice completely. After serving on the Western Front and enduring the psychological trauma of trench warfare, Owen began writing poetry that rejected patriotic idealism and instead confronted the brutal realities of modern war.

Owen’s poems are marked by their precision, moral seriousness, and deep compassion for the soldiers who fought and died anonymously. He was killed in action in 1918, just one week before the Armistice. Much of his work was published posthumously, giving his poetry an added sense of urgency and tragedy. Rather than glorifying sacrifice, Owen exposes war as a machinery of suffering, grief, and wasted youth.

No one can describe the pain of war quite like someone who has lived inside it. _Anthem for Doomed Youth_ carries that weight immediately. It isn’t interested in heroism or glory. It exists to show the horror, the waste, and the cruelty of the First World War without softening any of it.

**Wilfred Owen** fought in the war himself, and that experience reshaped his poetry entirely. What comes through here is a deep rejection of the patriotic fantasy surrounding war. Even the title feels bitter. These young soldiers are already condemned. The “anthem” meant to honor them becomes a kind of mockery, aimed at a society that encouraged boys into uniforms without understanding what awaited them. Owen isn’t imagining suffering. He’s reporting it, shaped by what he saw in the trenches.

The imagery is brutal and deliberate. Weapons replace prayers. The battlefield becomes its own twisted church, where noise stands in for mourning and death happens too fast for ceremony. Soldiers are reduced to something less than human, and even grief feels insufficient, unable to rise to the scale of what’s being destroyed. There’s no comfort offered here, only clarity.

I wasn’t familiar with Owen’s work before, but this poem feels like a powerful introduction. It doesn’t ask you to feel proud. It asks you to look directly at what war does, and to sit with the discomfort of that truth.

Here are my two favorites:

**Anthem For Doomed Youth**

> What passing-bells for these who die as cattle? Only the monstrous anger of the guns. Only the stuttering rifles' rapid rattle Can patter out their hasty orisons. No mockeries now for them; no prayers nor bells; Nor any voice of mourning save the choirs, The shrill, demented choirs of wailing shells; And bugles calling for them from sad shires. What candles may be held to speed them all? Not in the hands of boys, but in their eyes Shall shine the holy glimmers of good-byes. The pallor of girls' brows shall be their pall; Their flowers the tenderness of patient minds, And each slow dusk a drawing-down of blinds. 


**The Next War**

> Oh, Death was never enemy of ours! We laughed at him, we leagued with him, old chum. No soldier's paid to kick against His powers. We laughed, -knowing that better men would come, And greater wars: when each proud fighter brags He wars on Death, for lives; not men, for flags.
