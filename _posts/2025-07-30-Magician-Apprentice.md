Raymond E. Feist (born 1945) is an American fantasy writer best known for his _Riftwar Saga_, beginning with _Magician: Apprentice_ (1982). Drawing on the traditions of high fantasy established by Tolkien yet marked by a brisk, accessible style, Feist’s work helped define the epic fantasy of the late twentieth century. His novels combine the coming-of-age narrative with expansive world-building, political intrigue, and interdimensional conflict. Over four decades, Feist has created one of the most extensive shared universes in modern fantasy, spanning multiple continents, generations, and worlds.

I didn’t pick this up because I knew what it was. I just stumbled on it in a local bookstore, turned it over, read the back, and realized it was a fantasy novel. And that surprised me, because I’d never read fantasy before not once. I’d always thought of it as a genre full of elves, swords, and quests, something distant from the kind of books I usually gravitate toward. But there was something about it, the promise of another world, of magic and adventure, that made me curious enough to try. I wasn’t entirely sure what I was getting into, and in a way, that uncertainty was part of the appeal.

At first, the book moved slowly. Feist takes his time, introducing the world, the people, the kingdoms, the bits of lore that don’t seem important yet. It can feel overwhelming at first, so many names, so many places, so much history hinted at before it becomes relevant. And yet, there’s something methodical about the way he builds it. It’s as though he’s giving you the map before you start the journey, letting you feel the contours of the land and the rhythms of life within it. You start to notice that the small details matter: the way a soldier walks, the way an apprentice hesitates, the unspoken tensions between families and rulers.

And then the story opens up. The pace quickens, and suddenly what began as a quiet apprenticeship in a castle turns into something much bigger, A war, a clash of worlds, and a story about destiny. Feist’s world suddenly feels vast, alive, and dangerous. There’s a momentum to it that’s surprisingly modern, despite the book being written in the early eighties. Scenes that could feel dry on paper, training, learning, politics, instead carry this cinematic energy. Battles and confrontations are described with a rhythm that almost feels like a film playing in your mind, and moments of calm, reflection, or humor hit just as strongly as the big set pieces.

The heart of the story, though, is Pug. Watching him grow is what gives the book its emotional anchor. He starts as a shy, uncertain boy who struggles to understand his own abilities, and gradually becomes someone caught in forces far larger than himself. He’s not psychologically complex in the way a literary character like Woolf’s Lily Briscoe is, but he feels real enough that you care about his choices, his mistakes, and his small triumphs. His friendship with Tomas adds another layer of quiet emotion, you can feel the tension and affection in their relationship, and how their paths slowly diverge. It’s a subtle reminder that even in stories about magic and wars, the human relationships at the center of them are what linger.

Feist’s writing is clear and readable. It’s not ornate or flowery, and for some that might feel basic, but I found it surprisingly effective. The simplicity allows the world itself to shine. And yet, every now and then, a line or image lands with real force. There’s a kind of poetry tucked into his descriptions, a sense of wonder, a feeling that this world existed long before the story began and will continue long after it ends. You can feel the care he puts into Midkemia’s geography, history, and culture. Small human details, the way villagers interact, the politics of a court, the weight of decisions and give the story a grounded texture that makes even its most fantastical moments feel believable.


The sense of scale in this book is something I wasn’t prepared for. What starts as Pug’s personal journey quickly expands into a story that feels larger than life. Kingdoms, armies, and even other dimensions come into play, and yet Feist never loses sight of the human stakes. The story reminds you why people get attached to long fantasy series: because the world itself becomes as compelling as the story that unfolds within it. It’s immersive in a way that makes you reluctant to leave, even when you have to put the book down.

The characters are mostly archetypal, the mentor, the prince, the loyal friend but that doesn’t make them any less effective. They carry the story, and their clarity gives the narrative a kind of rhythm and comfort. Even when I could predict what a character might do next, I still wanted to see it happen. There’s pleasure in following someone familiar through challenges and triumphs, and Feist knows how to make even the expected moments satisfying.

By the time I finished, I wasn’t ready to let it go. I wanted to pick up Magician: Master immediately, to see what would happen next, to continue exploring the world I’d been introduced to. For a book I found by chance, with no expectations, it quietly pulled me in and refused to let me leave. That, I think, is part of its magic: even though it’s clearly a product of its time, it still has the ability to captivate a first-time reader in a way few books can.

It’s not perfect. It shows its age, and it’s not the most nuanced or literary writing out there. But it has heart, imagination, and a sense of wonder that feels rare and the kind of story that reminds you why fantasy exists in the first place. For a first fantasy read, it was the perfect entry point. It reminded me how powerful it can be to step into a world completely unknown, to allow yourself to be carried along by story, and to feel just a little awe at the sheer possibility of what a novel can create.

In the end, Magician: Apprentice is about beginnings, beginnings of characters, of worlds, of choices, and of stories. It’s about the kind of adventure that doesn’t just take you somewhere else, but also changes the way you look at reading itself. And for that, I’m grateful I stumbled on it by accident, because it became one of those rare books that sticks with you long after the last page.
