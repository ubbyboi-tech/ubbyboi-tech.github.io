**Karl Marx**, born in Trier in 1818, and Friedrich Engels, born in Barmen in 1820, remain two of the most influential and controversial thinkers of the modern world. Writing at a time when industrial capitalism was rapidly reshaping Europe, they sought not only to interpret the social transformations around them but to expose the economic structures beneath them. Their collaboration fused Marx's philosophical rigor with Engels' firsthand knowledge of industrial conditions, producing a body of work that challenged inherited ideas of class, labour, property, and power.

First published in 1848, _The Communist Manifesto_ was written on the eve of widespread political upheaval across Europe. Brief, polemical, and deliberately confrontational, it was intended as a call to consciousness rather than a detailed blueprint for revolution. Its language is sharp, urgent, and uncompromising, reflecting both the instability of its historical moment and the authors' belief that history itself is shaped by class struggle. Whether embraced or rejected, Marx and Engels' ideas continue to shape political debate, economic critique, and cultural thought across the world.

You don't have to agree with _The Communist Manifesto_ to admit one thing, it's one of the most important texts ever written. Period. Honestly, it should probably be required reading in schools. Not as doctrine, not as indoctrination, just as history, as theory, as something that shaped the world we're still living in. If you haven't read it, you kind of owe it to yourself to at least know what's in it.

I finally picked it up mostly for educational reasons. And reading it now, almost two hundred years later, is strange. Marx and Engels clearly had good intentions, even noble ones. Capitalism and the modern working class were both still in their infancy when this came out, and a lot of what they describe feels uncomfortably familiar. The depressing part is how little has changed when it comes to wages, labour rights, and exploitation. Living paycheck to paycheck doesn't feel like a historical artifact, it feels like the default.

> "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles."

> "The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent awe."

What Marx and Engels were trying to do was dismantle a system that forced workers to sell their labour for wages barely sufficient to survive, while the profits accumulated elsewhere. If that sounds familiar, it's because it is. Strip away the nineteenth-century language and you're left with problems that are still very much alive.

So yeah, Marx was right. Almost.

I'm not going to pretend I can fully analyse this book or Marxist thought in a single post. There's too much here, too many layers, and I'm still learning. But I do agree with Marx on the fundamental sins of capitalism. Sure, capitalism has produced innovation, comfort, and wealth, but at what cost? Billions exploited, billions still exploited, all justified "for the good of the economy."

That doesn't mean I think Marx had all the answers. I don't. And history has shown us some truly horrific outcomes under regimes that claimed communism as their banner. Human rights violations on a massive scale, repression, authoritarianism. On paper, communism can look humane and just. In practice, it has proven frighteningly easy to corrupt. That alone makes me think it cannot be a final solution, and maybe never should be.

> "The worker becomes all the poorer the more wealth he produces, the more his production increases in power and range."

> "Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other, Bourgeoisie and Proletariat."

Still, capitalism as it exists now is indefensible. It concentrates obscene amounts of wealth into the hands of a tiny minority while the majority struggles to survive. I'm not against private property. I'm not against people being wealthy. I am against hoarding. I am against a system where a few accumulate more than they could spend in ten lifetimes while billions live in poverty, die from preventable diseases, or lack basic healthcare and food.

Until everyone's basic needs are met, no one should have more than they could ever reasonably use. In a world where over a billion people live on less than a dollar a day, the existence of billionaires isn't neutral. It's violent.

> "The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win."

I don't have the answers. I don't think anyone ever has. Every ideology is a human construction, and every human construction is flawed. That's why no system should be treated as sacred. Everything must be debated, criticised, dismantled, and rebuilt if we want society to improve at all.

While reading the manifesto, I also came across an article titled [_Why We Never Hear About the Countries Where Socialism Works_](https://amieboakye.substack.com/p/why-we-never-hear-about-the-countries) by Amie, and it stuck with me. When most people hear the word socialism, their minds jump straight to bread lines, Venezuela, the Soviet Union, repression, failure. That association didn't happen by accident. It's been drilled into public consciousness, especially in the West, to shut down curiosity before it starts.

> "Communism does not deprive any man of the power to appropriate the products of society; all that it does is to deprive him of the power to subjugate the labour of others by means of such appropriations."

What's interesting is how often Nordic-style policies are dismissed with a knee-jerk "Venezuela!" response. The comparison is selective, intentional. If people start asking, _If it works there, why can't it work here?_, the whole narrative begins to crack.

Reading _The Communist Manifesto_ didn't turn me into a communist. What it did do was sharpen my skepticism toward capitalism and remind me that the world we live in is not inevitable. It was built. Which means it can also be changed. 
so that basically makes me a commie :)
