**Ryūnosuke Akutagawa** is often called the “father of the Japanese short story.” Writing in the early 20th century, he blended traditional Japanese themes with modernist techniques and psychological insight. His works often explore the ambiguity of truth, human nature, and morality through sharp, sometimes haunting storytelling. _Rashōmon_ (1915) is among his most famous tales — a dark, atmospheric story set in Kyoto that probes the fine line between survival and morality, truth and deception. Its influence extends beyond literature, inspiring Akira Kurosawa’s iconic film _Rashomon_, which expanded on its themes of subjective truth.

This is often described as a suicide note, and it’s hard not to read it that way. you have read it the way you look at old photographs of someone who is no longer alive, not to decode them, not to search for signs, but to understand how a life felt from the inside once hope had stopped being a possibility and become something to be examined instead.

Even if you knew nothing about Akutagawa, you would still sense it. The sadness, the exhaustion, the despair are all there, unannounced. He doesn’t try to explain himself. He doesn’t justify anything. He just gives words to emotions that had clearly been running unchecked for years. Regrets pile up quietly, one after another, until you almost want to tell him that it’s okay. But you can’t. So the only thing left is to try to understand him.

Written shortly before his death, and followed not long after by his suicide at the age of thirty-five, the piece reads less like a work of literature and more like a final accounting. It isn’t trying to persuade or confess. It’s observing itself.
It’s one thing to read about suicidal thoughts in fiction. It’s another to read something written so close to death. Akutagawa isn’t saying “this is me.” He’s asking a colder question: what if a man with my sensitivities, my intelligence, my self-awareness, still ends up a failure in the most fundamental sense? The text doesn’t guide you toward a conclusion. It just lays the pieces out and leaves them there.

> “If life collapses, art will at least remain precise.”

That precision runs through everything. You’re not meant to extract a moral from this work. You’re meant to feel the clarity of a mind that has already stepped halfway outside itself. The refusal to explain feels deliberate. Explanation would be a form of comfort, and Akutagawa refuses comfort entirely.

The sections that stayed with me most were _Mother_, _The Laughter of the Gods_, _Playing with Fire_, _The Birth_, _Punishment_, and _Defeat_. Each one feels less like a chapter and more like a snapshot. Moments where thought sharpens instead of softens.

“It is unfortunate for the gods that, unlike us, they cannot commit suicide.”

There’s bitterness there, but also something colder. A strange kind of envy. Not for death itself, but for the option of it.

> “I’ve heard you want to die,” she said.  
   “Yes—or rather, it’s not so much that I want to die as that I’m tired of living.”

Even when suicide is discussed directly, it’s handled with unsettling calm.

> “It would be a Platonic suicide, I suppose.”  
   “A Platonic double suicide.”  
   “He was amazed at his own sangfroid.”

Nothing is dramatized. That restraint makes it heavier, not lighter.

And then there’s guilt, directed inward, without mercy.

> “Why did this one have to be born—to come into the world like all the others, this world so full of suffering? Why did this one have to bear the destiny of having a father like me?”

The book doesn’t end with resolution. It doesn’t even end with despair in a traditional sense. It ends with clarity, and that might be worse. You’re not asked to judge him. You’re asked to stand close enough to see what thinking looks like when it has nowhere left to go.

This isn’t a confession. It’s a record. And reading it feels less like witnessing someone’s death than realizing how long they had already been gone.
