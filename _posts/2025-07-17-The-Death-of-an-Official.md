**Anton Chekhov** (1860–1904) was a Russian playwright and short story master, known for his subtle, layered portraits of ordinary people caught in the quiet absurdities of life. A doctor by profession, Chekhov brought a clinical eye to his characters — not to judge them, but to reveal the fragile contradictions they carry. His stories often feel simple at first glance, but they unravel into moments of quiet tragedy, awkward comedy, and aching humanity.

It’s funny — just a sneeze. That’s how it starts.

Ivan Dmitritch Chervyakov, a minor civil servant with a name that sounds almost like “worm,” sneezes during a night at the theater. Unfortunately, the sneeze lands on the bald head of General Brizzhalov, a high-ranking official. Chervyakov panics. Apologizes. The general waves it off. End of story?

Not even close.

> “Pardon, your Excellency, I… I didn’t mean to…”

This is a story about how anxiety eats people alive. Chervyakov becomes convinced that his sneeze has ruined everything — his reputation, his job, his life. So he apologizes again. And again. Each time he tries to explain himself, it becomes more excruciating. We, the readers, can see it unraveling in slow motion. And it’s hilarious. And horrifying.

This is social anxiety before the term existed — distilled into one man’s slow-motion emotional collapse. And what’s wild is that the general never actually threatens him. He doesn’t yell. He barely reacts. It’s not the system that crushes Chervyakov — it’s his _perception_ of the system. The fear of authority becomes so intense it turns into a death sentence.

> “He reached home, lay down on the sofa, and died.”

Just like that.

Chekhov doesn’t over-explain it. There’s no dramatic twist. No tragic past revealed. He just _dies_. From shame? From exhaustion? From being ignored after putting himself through so much emotional chaos?

It’s absurd. And it’s perfect.

What struck me most was how _small_ the problem was. And how _huge_ it became.

Chervyakov doesn’t die from illness or violence. He dies from overthinking. From shame. From needing approval in a world that doesn’t really care.

> “He wanted to protest, but his voice failed him.”

It’s heartbreaking, and also a little bit hilarious, because who hasn’t spiraled after saying the wrong thing in public? Who hasn’t replayed an interaction a hundred times, imagining how you looked, how you sounded? Chekhov gets it — and he turns it into art.

Chekhov doesn’t moralize. He just points a quiet finger at how we live — how absurd it is to be so fragile, so status-obsessed, so consumed with appearances that a sneeze can undo a man.

_The Death of an Official_ is short, sharp, and strangely timeless. It made me laugh, then wince, then sit very still. I don’t feel like I need to reread it anytime soon. Not because I didn’t like it — but because it already said what it needed to. Clearly. Completely.

Like all great short stories, it leaves behind a faint ache — and the slight worry that maybe, just maybe, you too could die from a sneeze.

> “He did not sleep all night, and was tormented by vague reminiscences.”

> “I am not apologizing in order to receive a reward…”

> “You are making fun of me, sir,” the general said, turning away with a look of disgust.

> “He got home, lay down on the sofa, and died.”
