# The Right Message, the Wrong Voice: Reading _We Should All Be Feminists_

I didn’t read _We Should All Be Feminists_ with disagreement in mind. I also didn’t read it expecting to be convinced. What I felt instead was a quiet distance that never quite closed. It wasn’t the ideas themselves that unsettled me, but the way they were delivered.

The title set that feeling in motion early. “We **Should** All Be Feminists” doesn’t sound like an invitation so much as a conclusion already reached. It tells the reader where they are meant to arrive before the journey even begins. As I read, I kept noticing how that certainty shaped everything that followed.

There were moments where I found myself nodding along. The message — that rigid gender roles can be limiting, that expectations placed on both women and men deserve to be questioned — didn’t feel unreasonable. In fact, much of it felt familiar. But familiarity isn’t the same as persuasion, and agreement doesn’t automatically follow recognition.

What held me back wasn’t opposition, but tone. The book rarely pauses to sit with doubt. It moves confidently from experience to conclusion, as if the emotional weight of a story is enough to settle the argument. For readers already inclined to agree, that confidence might feel reassuring. For someone neutral, it creates distance.

There’s a passage about cooking that stayed with me for this reason. The idea is that women cook more often because they have been socialized to do so, not because of biology — a point illustrated by the contrast between home cooking and professional chefs, who are mostly men.

> “Boys and girls are undeniably different biologically, but socialization exaggerates the differences, and then starts a self-fulfilling process. Take cooking, for example. Today, women in general are more likely to do housework than men – cooking and cleaning. But why is that? Is it because women are born with a cooking gene or because over the years they have been socialized to see cooking as their role? I was going to say that perhaps women are born with a cooking gene until I remembered that the majority of famous cooks in the world – who are given the fancy title of ‘chef’ – are men.”


I understood the intention behind the example, but it didn’t reflect my own experience. I know many women, including my mother, who do most of the housework not out of obligation, but out of care. My mother is a hardworking, independent woman, and the work she does at home has always felt like an expression of love rather than inequality. I cook too, without shame, and when I do, everyone eats. When someone else cooks, the same happens. In that context, cooking has never felt symbolic. It’s just part of living together.

While reading, I kept thinking about how easily patterns are turned into explanations. The fact that something happens more often doesn’t automatically explain why it happens in every individual case. Meaning can be lost when outcomes are treated as evidence on their own. Choice, affection, habit, and preference rarely make it into the conversation.

The book defines feminism as a belief in equality, which makes disagreement feel unnecessary, even unreasonable. But that simplicity also avoids the internal disagreements and tensions that exist within the ideology itself. By smoothing those edges, the message becomes easier to accept, but also harder to engage with honestly.

There’s an irony in arguing against rigid expectations while placing one directly in the title. The essay challenges limiting roles, yet never questions the pressure created by telling readers what a good, informed person _should_ be. That tension lingered with me more than any single anecdote.

When I finished the book, I didn’t feel angry or dismissive. I just felt unconvinced. The message may be pointing in the right direction, but the voice delivering it leaves little room for hesitation, reflection, or disagreement.

Some ideas need space to breathe. This one arrives fully formed, confident in its own clarity. For me, that certainty made it harder to listen, even when I sensed that parts of the message itself were worth hearing.
