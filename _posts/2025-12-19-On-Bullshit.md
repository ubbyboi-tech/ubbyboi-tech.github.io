## On Bullshit, Confusion, and Why So Much Modern Talk Feels Empty

Reading _On Bullshit_ by Harry Frankfurt was strange in a quiet way. I wasn’t moved or provoked; I was confused. Frankfurt spends pages carefully defining something we all use casually, and at first it felt unnecessary. Why analyze bullshit when everyone already recognizes it?

That assumption turned out to be wrong. The more I read, the clearer it became that I had been using the word “bullshit” without understanding what made it different from lying, exaggeration, or ignorance. My confusion wasn’t a failure of comprehension, it was the result of realizing how rarely I stop to ask what kind of speech I’m actually hearing, or producing, every day.

Once Frankfurt draws his key distinction, the essay snaps into focus.

## What bullshit actually is: the liar vs. the bullshitter

Most people think bullshit is just another word for lying. Frankfurt insists it isn’t and he’s right.

A liar is still tethered to the truth. To lie successfully, you have to know, or think you know, what the truth is. The liar’s goal is to replace that truth with a false version. In doing so, the liar acknowledges that truth matters. The lie only works because the truth exists in the background.

The bullshitter is different. The bullshitter is not primarily concerned with whether what they say is true or false. Truth is not being attacked or defended, it is simply irrelevant. What matters is the impression produced: sounding confident, appearing informed, filling silence, winning approval.

Frankfurt’s claim is unsettling because it suggests that bullshit is not a weaker form of lying, but something more corrosive. While lies distort reality, bullshit ignores it altogether.

The Oxford English Dictionary helps clarify this. It defines **bull** (in this sense) as “trivial, insincere, or untruthful talk,” often described as “hot air.” A **bull session** is an informal conversation in which participants are not held to what they say. These definitions point to speech that floats free of commitment and language that sounds informational but isn’t accountable to facts.

Frankfurt sharpens the idea further. Bullshit preserves the _form_ of serious speech while abandoning its discipline. Unlike a bull session, where no one expects literal accuracy, bullshit pretends to be real communication. It asks to be taken seriously without submitting to reality.

## Relationship slogans: when certainty replaces understanding

This becomes obvious in relationship advice, especially in slogans that circulate as unquestionable truths. One of the most popular is: _“If he wanted to, he would.”_ The appeal is clear. It offers clarity where relationships are messy and eliminates the need for difficult conversations.

But this is precisely why it functions as bullshit. The phrase presents itself as an explanation of human behavior while remaining indifferent to whether it is true in any specific case. Wanting is not the same as knowing how to act. Desire does not automatically translate into confidence, awareness, or timing.

The slogan does not investigate any of this. It bypasses reality entirely. It sounds decisive, but its decisiveness is emotional rather than truthful. In Frankfurt’s terms, it is not wrong so much as unconcerned with being right.

## Political slogans: meaning without measurement

Political language is one of the most fertile environments for bullshit because it rewards confidence over accuracy. Consider President George W. Bush’s claim that _“freedom is on the march in Iraq.”_ The sentence sounds factual, even historical. Yet the closer one looks, the emptier it becomes.

What does “freedom” mean here? Who has it? How is its progress measured? The sentence answers none of these questions. Instead, it relies on abstraction and metaphor to create reassurance and moral momentum.

This is not necessarily a lie. It may even be sincere. But sincerity is beside the point. The statement is designed to create an impression, not to describe conditions on the ground. It floats free of evidence while borrowing the tone of truth, textbook bullshit.

## Self-help and hustle culture: universal answers to individual lives

The same structure appears in self-help and productivity culture. Advice like _“wake up at 5 a.m. and your life will change”_ or _“everyone has the same 24 hours”_ is presented as practical wisdom but often functions as bullshit.

These statements take one person’s experience and elevate it into a universal rule. What disappears are differences in psychology, health, resources, environment, and circumstance. The advice is not offered conditionally or experimentally; it assumes that what worked once should work everywhere.

The problem is not that this advice is always false. It’s that it’s delivered without serious concern for whether it applies to the reader’s actual life. Self-help becomes a performance of certainty rather than an engagement with reality.

## Cultural bullshit: when words stop meaning what they say

Bullshit does not always arise from manipulation. Sometimes it becomes embedded in everyday social life. A familiar example in Ethiopian culture is the way time is spoken about. An event may be announced for 8:00 p.m., even though everyone involved understands that nothing will actually begin until much later.

When someone says, _“I’ll be there early,”_ the statement often carries no literal commitment to clock-time. This is not lying. No one is deceived. Speaker and listener share the same understanding.

Yet the language preserves the appearance of factual precision while abandoning its connection to reality. The time is stated, but time is not what is being discussed. In Frankfurt’s terms, this is bullshit normalized into ritual words that remain while their truth-conditions quietly disappear.

## Why bullshit feels good

Bullshit survives because it is comforting. It reduces complexity without demanding understanding and offers certainty without effort. In a world that is messy and ambiguous, bullshit provides emotional relief.

Unlike careful speech, which requires hesitation and restraint, bullshit moves quickly. It sounds confident. It turns difficult questions into simple answers and unresolved tensions into slogans. It delivers the feeling of meaning without the labor of making meaning.

That efficiency is precisely what makes it attractive.

## Why sincerity isn’t enough

One of Frankfurt’s most unsettling claims is that bullshit does not require bad faith. The bullshitter may be sincere, well-intentioned, and emotionally invested. But sincerity does not guarantee truth.

A liar knows the truth and hides it. The bullshitter may never have bothered to find out what the truth is at all. Their speech is guided by impression rather than accuracy, confidence rather than care.

When sincerity becomes the standard of trustworthiness, we lower the bar that keeps language anchored to reality. Passion replaces precision, and conviction replaces correctness.

## Cultural warning: when truth becomes optional

The real cost of bullshit is not misinformation, but indifference. When we stop demanding that words answer to reality, we stop treating truth as something worth the effort. Language becomes a tool for self-expression rather than a means of understanding the world we share.

Frankfurt’s warning is that this indifference corrodes our ability to think together. Without a commitment to truth, there is nothing left to argue about—only performances competing for attention. In that environment, bullshit does not merely survive; it becomes the default mode of speech.
