Kahlil Gibran was a Lebanese-American poet, writer, and artist whose mystical and philosophical works have resonated worldwide for over a century. Born in the Ottoman Empire and later emigrating to the United States, Gibran’s writing blends Eastern spirituality, Christian mysticism, and Romanticism. His best-known work, _The Prophet_ (1923), is a collection of poetic essays offering meditations on love, freedom, joy, sorrow, and the human experience. Its lyrical simplicity and universal wisdom have made it a timeless classic beloved across cultures.

I read _The Prophet_ back in high school — in Arabic. I can’t remember which grade exactly, but I do remember how deeply it struck me at the time. It felt full of wisdom, like every line carried a weight beyond the words themselves. So I figured, why not come back to it now, years later, and try it in English?

Reading it in English felt... different. Not bad, but noticeably less powerful than I remembered. The message is still there — clear, gentle, moving — but the magic felt softer this time. Maybe it’s the translation. Some things just don’t cross over with the same depth. You lose the rhythm, the nuances, that subtle feeling you only get when a line hits you in your own language. You know what I mean?

Still, I found beauty in it. That reminder that our attachments to others should feel like freedom, not possession — that stayed with me. So did the famous line:

> _“Your children are not your children…”_

It’s a lesson in letting go, in recognizing that love is not about holding on, but about allowing others to be who they are.

The simplicity of Gibran’s writing is part of its strength. It feels like listening to ancient truths — calm, clear, and stripped of complication. It doesn’t try to dazzle you with big ideas. It just offers quiet insights about life, love, work, sorrow, joy, and everything in between.

I’d still recommend it — especially if you want something short and meaningful. Just... maybe try it in the language that speaks closest to your heart.

> Your children are not your children.  
> They are the sons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself.”

> “Work is love made visible.”

> “Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart.”

> “Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself.”

> “You give but little when you give of your possessions.  
> It is when you give of yourself that you truly give.”
