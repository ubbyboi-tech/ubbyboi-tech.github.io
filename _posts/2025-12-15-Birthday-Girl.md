**Haruki Murakami** is one of the most widely read and quietly divisive writers of contemporary literature. Emerging in postwar Japan, his fiction blends the everyday with the surreal, loneliness with intimacy, and emotional restraint with sudden moments of metaphysical strangeness. His characters often drift through modern life slightly out of sync, drawn to solitude, music, memory, and moments of inexplicable encounter.

Murakami’s short fiction distills these themes into their most minimal forms. In stories like _Birthday Girl_, he strips away excess narrative and leaves behind a single question, a fleeting interaction, or a subtle rupture in time. The result is fiction that resists explanation and instead lingers as mood and afterimage. Rather than offering answers, Murakami asks his readers to sit with uncertainty, to notice what remains unsaid, and to recognize how small moments quietly shape the lives we grow into.

## What Did She Wish For?

If someone asked me what I would have wished for on my twentieth birthday, I don’t think I would have had an answer either. That’s probably why _Birthday Girl_ didn’t hit me with a strong emotion. I didn’t feel sad, or shocked, or deeply moved. It felt normal while I was reading it. Quiet, even. And yet the question it leaves behind kept circling in my head long after the story ended, what did she wish for?

Part of that question stayed with me because I recognized myself in the girl’s situation. She’s alone on her birthday, working late, stepping into a space she normally wouldn’t enter. That kind of aloneness didn’t strike me as tragic. It felt familiar. I’ve always found peace in being alone, not because I want to escape people, but because silence lets me be present in a world of my own. Even being quiet with someone else feels enough. So her isolation didn’t read as loneliness to me, it read as a natural state.

Murakami never tells us what her wish is. When she’s given the chance to make a single wish, the story deliberately refuses to reveal it. Instead of feeling frustrated by that absence, I found myself wondering whether her wish would even be different from what most people want. Safety. Stability. Love. A life that works. Nothing dramatic. Nothing extraordinary.

> “You can wish for anything you want. But only once.”

Maybe the wish works precisely because it isn’t grand. Maybe it simply aligns with who she already is. The story suggests that the most important choices in life are rarely theatrical. They happen quietly, without ceremony, without the person even realizing the weight of what they’ve chosen.

What stayed with me most wasn’t the wish itself, but the old man. He appears briefly, speaks calmly, sets a rule, and disappears. He doesn’t feel fully real, but he doesn’t feel unreal either. I didn’t read him as a magical figure so much as a presence that shows up at a certain point in life, the moment when you are forced to choose, whether you realize you are choosing or not.

> “Once you make the wish, it cannot be undone.”

We all step away at times, especially after conflict or uncertainty, just to be alone and think. In that sense, isolation isn’t unusual, it’s where decisions quietly form. The old man feels less like a supernatural being and more like time itself, neutral, patient, unbothered by human hesitation.

The ending made me think about age in a way that felt unexpectedly comforting. Not aging as something dramatic, but adulthood as recognition rather than transformation. The older woman’s life sounds ordinary and settled. There’s no sense of loss, just acceptance. That resonated with me. Growing older hasn’t felt like becoming someone entirely new, but like slowly realizing what I’ve already chosen.

> “It wasn’t a bad life, she thought. It wasn’t a bad life at all.”

I don’t move through life clearly naming what I want. I move, and only later understand what I was choosing. If I were forced to make a wish, the difficulty wouldn’t be deciding what to wish for, but accepting the consequences of choosing just one thing. Maybe that’s why I don’t care much about birthdays either. They feel less like celebrations and more like reminders that time is moving forward, and that can be quietly unsettling.

Maybe that’s why _Birthday Girl_ feels so calm. There’s no warning, no lesson, no clear moral. Just the idea that wishes don’t announce themselves when they happen. You only notice them years later, when your life has already taken a shape, one you may not have consciously chosen, but one you recognize as your own.

And maybe that recognition, rather than the wish itself, is what the story is really about.

> “ ‘No matter what they wish for, no matter how far they go, people can never be anything but themselves. That’s all.”
