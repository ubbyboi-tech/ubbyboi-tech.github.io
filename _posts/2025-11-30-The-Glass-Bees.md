**Ernst Jünger** was one of the most enigmatic figures of twentieth-century German literature. A soldier in two world wars, a diarist of combat and catastrophe, and later a detached philosophical observer of modernity, Jünger spent his long life examining power, technology, and the fate of the individual under historical pressure. His early writings glorified endurance and discipline, but his later works turned increasingly inward, questioning the spiritual and moral costs of technological civilization.

Written in 1957, _The Glass Bees_ belongs to this later phase. Neither a conventional science-fiction novel nor a political allegory in the narrow sense, it is a meditation on automation, surveillance, and the erosion of human agency. Jünger imagines a world in which innovation no longer serves human flourishing but quietly reorganizes life according to efficiency, control, and spectacle. The novel reflects postwar anxieties about industrial power, totalitarian systems, and the reduction of the individual to function, anxieties shaped by Jünger’s firsthand experience of Europe’s ideological disasters.

Subtle, restrained, and unsettling, _The Glass Bees_ stands as one of Jünger’s most prescient works, a quiet warning about the costs of progress when technology outruns ethical responsibility.

One day I was roaming around inside a bookstore waiting for a friend to show up, killing time, not really looking for anything. In the meantime I came across _The Glass Bees_. Before I could think much about it, my friend called me outside. We came back in again later, and somehow I found the book again. He pointed out that it was an NYRB edition, something I didn’t even know about at the time, and immediately wanted it himself. That was the day I learned that anything NYRB puts out is basically top tier.

It was a dense read. A lot of the points went over my head, I think. Still, it was enjoyable in that slow, demanding way where you feel the book working on you even when you don’t fully grasp it. What stuck with me most were Jünger’s reflections on technology, the quiet passing of old values into new ones, and that heavy sense of being out of place in a world that no longer has room for you.

This is speculative fiction, but not in the way most people expect. There isn’t much of a narrative, and if you’re looking for plot, momentum, or payoff, this will probably frustrate you. Instead, the novel is built around atmosphere and unease. The theme of technology gone wrong feels uncomfortably close to home. Mechanical animals designed to entertain or amaze slowly become instruments of surveillance and violence. Reading this now, it’s impossible not to think of modern drones or bio-inspired machines, ideas that once sounded futuristic but now feel disturbingly normal.

> “Technical means tend to emancipate themselves from the intentions that produced them.”

What really unsettled me was the idea that these inventions aren’t created with evil intentions. They start as spectacle, curiosity, entertainment. Then they evolve. That feels very current. Jünger doesn’t predict the internet or digital capitalism, but I couldn’t stop thinking about companies like Google while reading. The quiet accumulation of power, the way control becomes invisible, the ease with which intentions can change once the system is built. “Don’t be evil” feels fragile in a world like this.

The historical and political context adds another layer. At its core, the story follows a disenchanted soldier trying to find his footing in a transformed society. That story could exist in almost any era. Jünger’s use of science fiction seems less about predicting the future and more about recreating disorientation. The reader is never fully grounded, just like the protagonist. Subtle clues about how the world has changed are dropped gradually, keeping you uneasy, unsure of what kind of place this really is.

The figure of Zapparoni is especially fascinating. I saw a YouTube review suggesting that Zapparoni might not simply be a Bill Gates or Walt Disney type, but could also represent Hitler, a man Jünger never met but whose shadow defined his time. That reading makes sense. Zapparoni and Hitler both dominate their era, bending society to their will. Both reduce people to drones, whether through ideology or through technology.

> “The individual becomes interchangeable, valued only for efficiency.”

That idea sits at the heart of the novel. Workers are no longer people but functions. Humanity is flattened into usefulness. Progress becomes a justification rather than a question.

This isn’t a comforting book. Its pacing is slow, its movement inward rather than forward. For some readers, that will be a deal-breaker. But if you’re willing to let the plot sink beneath reflection and memory, _The Glass Bees_ offers something rare, a form of science fiction that doesn’t dazzle but unsettles.

> “What frightens me is not the machine itself, but the spirit that commands it.”

I didn’t understand everything in this book, and I don’t think I was meant to. What matters is how long it stays with you. It doesn’t scream its warnings. It whispers them. And that might be what makes it so effective.
