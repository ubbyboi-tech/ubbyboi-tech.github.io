**Karl Marx** (1818–1883) was a philosopher, economist, and revolutionary whose writings reshaped how the modern world understands labour, class, and power. Writing in the midst of industrial capitalism’s explosive growth, Marx sought not merely to interpret society but to expose the mechanisms by which wealth is accumulated and inequality sustained. His economic works, often polemical yet rigorously analytical, remain among the most influential critiques of capitalism ever produced.

_Wage-Labour and Capital_, originally delivered as lectures and later published as a pamphlet, stands as one of Marx’s most accessible economic texts. Here, Marx strips capitalism down to its bare essentials, revealing how wage labour functions as a system of exploitation rather than exchange. More than a historical document, the text continues to resonate in an era marked by precarity, inequality, and the global commodification of human work.

Reading _Wage-Labour and Capital_ felt like my brain doing backflips. Economics has never been my thing, and honestly, it still isn’t. I don’t naturally gravitate toward graphs, abstractions, or economic terminology, and there were moments where my head just went a bit wooey. That said, Marx somehow made this far more digestible than I expected. It’s short, tight, and surprisingly clear, especially compared to what people imagine when they hear “Marxist economics.”

I still struggle to fully immerse myself in Marx’s economic writings. I understand their importance and I agree with him most of the time, but I’m much more drawn to his political and philosophical work. Still, this text worked for me. It’s concise, direct, and stripped of unnecessary ornament. Capitalism sucks, and if you can read this and defend it without hesitation, I honestly don’t know what to tell you.

Like _The Communist Manifesto_, this is something that needs to be read slowly. Line by line. Thought by thought. Especially for a worker like myself. Marx isn’t trying to overwhelm you here, he’s trying to teach you how the system actually functions. The key word is **relationships**. Wage, labour, and capital don’t exist independently, they are bound together in a structure that systematically benefits one class at the expense of another. Once you understand how these pieces interact, you suddenly have a concrete foundation from which to criticise capitalism, not emotionally, but structurally.

> “Labour is the commodity which the worker sells to the capitalist.”

What really hit me was how terrifyingly relevant this still is. This was written over 150 years ago, yet it maps almost perfectly onto the modern world. Living paycheck to paycheck. Labour treated as a commodity. Productivity rising while wages stagnate. If this doesn’t describe the present, I genuinely don’t know what does. Marx makes it painfully clear that capitalism does not operate in the interest of workers, and never has. If we want to change the system, we first have to understand it, and this pamphlet does exactly that.

> “The worker becomes all the poorer the more wealth he produces.”

Marx’s core argument is straightforward but devastating. Labour produces value. Capitalists do not create value themselves, they extract it. The worker is paid only enough to survive, while the surplus value created by their labour is appropriated by the capitalist. Without workers, the capitalist’s ideas would remain abstract, stuck in their head. And yet, it’s the worker who remains disposable.

That said, I do stumble when Marx brushes past human nature. The idea that people will willingly share bread equally feels idealistic. Many people want to be above others, not beside them. Power, hierarchy, ego, these don’t disappear just because a system changes. Maybe Marx underestimated how deeply those impulses run. Or maybe he believed material conditions shape behaviour more than we’re willing to admit. I’m still undecided.

> “Capital is dead labour, that, vampire-like, only lives by sucking living labour.”

> “Wages are determined through the antagonistic struggle between capitalist and worker.”

What I do know is that _Wage-Labour and Capital_ succeeds in one crucial way. It gives you language. It gives you structure. It explains why exploitation isn’t accidental, but necessary for capitalism to function. Reading it feels like swimming in pure “capitalism core”, exhausting at times, but clarifying. I didn’t walk away with all the answers, but I walked away better equipped to ask the right questions.

> “The interests of capital and the interests of wage-labour are diametrically opposed.”
