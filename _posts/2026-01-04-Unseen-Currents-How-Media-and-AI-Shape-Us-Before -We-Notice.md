## How Media and AI Shape Us Before We Notice

Most of us assume technology changes the world only after we learn how to use it, but often the change happens before we even notice.

Once a technology becomes part of everyday life, it fades into the background. Like air or electricity, it works silently. We only notice it when something goes wrong, during a power outage, a system failure, or a moment of sensory overload. By then, the shift has already occurred.

This is what Marshall McLuhan meant when he said, _“the medium is the message.”_ Technologies do more than carry content, they reshape how we think, feel, and behave. Electric light, for example, didn’t change what we saw, but when and how long we stayed awake. Night disappeared without anyone voting for it, and society reorganized around that change long before most people reflected on it.

### Social Media

Social media seems like a tool for connection. It lets us share images, videos, music, and messages instantly with people all over the globe. In McLuhan’s terms, it collapses distance and sequence, making the world feel smaller and faster.

But social media is more than a messenger. It immerses us, emotionally and rhythmically, rather than allowing detached observation. Algorithms push content that we like, gradually shaping attention, taste, and even habits. The medium influences behavior more than the content itself.

Many of us notice this in small ways. Some people, myself included, struggle to eat or relax without watching something, often meaningless content, just to feed the brain’s craving for stimulation. Features like Spotify Wrapped take this further, turning private listening habits into public performance. Sharing them becomes a way to prove presence, to signal, to participate. Walter Benjamin captured a related idea when he wrote, _“That which withers in the age of mechanical reproduction is the aura of the work of art.”_ Our experiences, once unique and intimate, now become repeatable, shareable, and curated for visibility.

### Artificial Intelligence and Creative Work

AI represents a whole new level of technological influence. It doesn’t just deliver content, it produces it. With a single prompt, you can generate text, images, animation, or even voices in seconds.

In animation, AI automates tasks like rotoscoping, rigging, in-betweening, and backgrounds. I’ve used these tools under tight deadlines with peers, generating entire three-minute sequences quickly. They increase efficiency, reduce costs, and allow exploration of new styles, but they also subtly reshape values. In UI/UX design, AI can auto-generate color systems, typography, and design components. I found myself skipping foundational practices because the tools made them seem unnecessary. The medium begins to shape what I consider important or even worth doing.

I once asked my animation instructor what his concerns were about AI taking over animation, and he said it would never happen. I insisted, asking, “What if it did?” He looked at me and said, “Why is that your concern?” I explained, “If it happened, why would I even learn animation?” He smiled and said, “We as humans are creative, we have abstract thought and nuanced storytelling. AI can do better in computational power and data processing, but it can’t replace that. Be proud that you are creative, because humans created AI, and we can make something more creative than that.” Even as I nodded, I thought to myself, AI is improving every day, and it’s already changing how we work, think, and create.

AI also blurs truth and fiction. In an information-saturated world, this puts accuracy and fabrication on equal footing, making critical engagement more necessary than ever.

### Riding the Invisible Tide

There’s no simple fix, but simply noticing how technology shapes us is already a step toward understanding. We may not be able to step outside these environments entirely, but we can learn to see them, reflect, and engage deliberately.

Technology has always influenced us before we were aware, and it will continue to do so. The question is not whether it shapes us, but how we respond, adapt, and remain creatively human in the process.
