**Du Fu** (712–770) is often called **China’s greatest realist poet**. Living through war, famine, and personal hardship during the Tang dynasty, his poems blend social conscience with deep emotional truth. Where Li Bai floats into mysticism, Du Fu stays grounded — his work is personal, political, and painfully human.

I'm not a scholar of Chinese poetry,

This was the first Chinese poem I’ve ever really sat with — not just glanced at in passing or seen quoted in a book — and I didn’t expect to connect with it so quickly. The language is simple, the image is clear: a man’s house is being destroyed by the wind, and he’s powerless to stop it. You can feel how exposed he is — not just to the elements, but to everything going wrong in his world. The rain is coming in, the straw is flying off the roof, and he's standing there watching it all happen.

But what caught me off guard was the shift near the end. The poem zooms out — and suddenly, he’s thinking about _everyone_ in his position. He imagines building a giant house where all the poor and struggling people could stay dry, could be safe. He even says: if that house existed, **he’d be fine dying in the open** — that’s how much it would mean to him.

That moment felt incredibly human. Not preachy. Not performative. Just honest.
