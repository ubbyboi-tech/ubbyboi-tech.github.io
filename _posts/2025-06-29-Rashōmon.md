Ryūnosuke Akutagawa is often called the “father of the Japanese short story.” Writing in the early 20th century, he blended traditional Japanese themes with modernist techniques and psychological insight. His works often explore the ambiguity of truth, human nature, and morality through sharp, sometimes haunting storytelling. _Rashōmon_ (1915) is among his most famous tales — a dark, atmospheric story set in Kyoto that probes the fine line between survival and morality, truth and deception. Its influence extends beyond literature, inspiring Akira Kurosawa’s iconic film _Rashomon_, which expanded on its themes of subjective truth.

A friend recommended starting with _Rashōmon_ before jumping into _In a Grove_, and I’m glad I listened. I tried to make sense of it by jotting down some cryptic lines, trying to philosophize, but honestly, the story resists that kind of deep dissection. It’s too short, too condensed. Instead, what Akutagawa offers is a sharp, compact meditation on the fragile moral code that underpins human society.

At its heart, _Rashōmon_ raises a question about necessity — stealing, survival, the blurry line between right and wrong when you’re desperate. When life comes down to mere survival, those clear-cut laws written in books or preached in temples suddenly feel irrelevant. It’s easy to be self-righteous when your stomach’s full — and Akutagawa knows this all too well.


>“he suddenly shot his right hand from his pimple to the scruff of her neck. As he grasped her, his words all but bit into her flesh: “You won’t blame me, then, for taking your clothes. That’s what I have to do to keep from starving to death.”


The story is set in the late Heian period, a time when social order is crumbling, and the world itself feels like it’s tipping into chaos — almost with a gothic shadow hanging over it. The protagonist, a lowly servant recently fired, sits beneath the ruined Rashōmon gate, wrestling with the stark choice of whether to cling to morality or abandon it to survive.

Normally, I don’t write much about individual short stories, but this one pulled me in enough to want to explore more of Akutagawa. His writing is known for blending innovation with Japanese tradition, and even in translation, I could glimpse his mastery — the way he introduces the servant and then gently reshapes our perspective by adding unexpected details feels fresh and subtle.

One image that stayed with me was his description of the abandoned corpses beneath the gate:  

> “The bodies looked so much like clay dolls, that you might doubt that any of them had ever been alive.”

That chilling line cuts right through the story’s quiet tension.

I’m convinced now — I’ll be diving into his full collection soon.


> “The wind rose and scattered the dead leaves about the old gate.”

> “What is right and what is wrong? Sometimes it is difficult to tell.”

> “When life pushes you to the edge, what choice do you have but to survive?”

> “I could no longer live by the old laws.”

> “One day, I too must live in the shadows, as others have done before me.”
