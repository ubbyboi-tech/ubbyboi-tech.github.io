## Between Nothing and Forever

What happens after we die, is it blackness, like before I was born, or some form of eternal existence? The idea of nothingness terrifies me — the same nothing I experienced before I existed.

## Happiness and Eternity

Can happiness really be eternal? I don’t think so, because happiness, like all emotions, depends on change. It is fleeting by nature and only meaningful when it arises alongside struggle, loss, or discomfort. Without contrast, would eternal happiness even feel like happiness, or would it simply become a blank, unnoticeable state? If an afterlife promises eternal happiness, I wonder whether it’s truly happiness at all, or just a constant, neutral state, a world without peaks or valleys, where the very feeling of joy has no depth because suffering no longer exists to give it meaning.

## Abrahamic Religions

Many religions, like Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, describe the afterlife as a place of eternal reward or punishment. Heaven offers everlasting joy, while hell promises unending suffering. These ideas suggest a kind of cosmic justice: the virtuous are rewarded, the wrongdoers punished. But if happiness and suffering are inherently relational and dynamic, can a never-ending heaven truly feel like happiness? And if suffering is erased, does pleasure retain its meaning? I find myself grappling with this tension, the promise of eternal states feels, in some ways, both comforting and abstract, like a concept I can understand yet cannot fully inhabit. It makes the question of what comes after death even sharper, will I be nothing, as I was before I was born, or trapped in a timeless, unchanging existence that my emotions cannot recognize?

## Buddhism and Impermanence

Buddhism offers a different approach. It frames life and death not in terms of eternal reward or punishment, but as a cycle of impermanence, transformation, and ethical living. Happiness, in Buddhist thought, is not a static destination but a practice: mindfulness, compassion, and awareness cultivate inner peace. There is no eternal bliss in the way Western religions promise it, but perhaps that is what makes it more relatable — joy arises in moments, and its depth is shaped by struggle, effort, and understanding. Here, death is not a final judgment, but another phase in a continuous path toward wisdom and release from suffering.

## Comparative Reflection

Looking at these perspectives together, the contrast is striking. Abrahamic religions present eternal states, comforting yet abstract, while Buddhism embraces change and impermanence, offering practical ways to live with meaning now. Both frameworks shape how we experience life, death, and emotion, yet neither provides a final answer to the haunting question: will I return to nothingness, or continue in a form I cannot imagine?

## Conclusion

While the afterlife remains a mystery, reflecting on these perspectives allows me to live more consciously, to embrace each fleeting moment of happiness, and to face the unknown with curiosity and awareness. Perhaps understanding impermanence, and our own limited time, is the closest we get to reconciling with what comes after.
