**Jenny Erpenbeck** is one of the most precise and quietly devastating voices in contemporary European literature. Born in East Berlin in 1967, she grew up surrounded by the fractures of German history, political upheaval, displacement, and erasure, themes that would later become central to her work. Trained as a bookbinder, theatre director, and writer, Erpenbeck brings an architectural sense of structure to her fiction, constructing narratives where time, memory, and place are as important as character.

Her writing is marked by restraint rather than excess. Erpenbeck does not dramatize history, she allows it to seep into the lives of ordinary people, showing how vast political forces reshape private existence almost silently. In her work, homes are built, occupied, abandoned, and destroyed, while individuals struggle to secure permanence in a world governed by impermanence. _Visitation_ stands as one of her most accomplished works, a novel that treats history not as a sequence of events but as an erosive force acting upon land, bodies, and memory.

>  “People come and go, the garden remains.”

This might honestly be the best book I’ve read so far in 2025, top tier, no hesitation.

I didn’t even plan on reading _Visitation_. One slow, forgettable afternoon, my cousin handed it to me and said, “Just try it.” That was it. From the first chapter, I was caught. With every episode, I felt myself sinking deeper into it, the kind of quiet pull that doesn’t let go. Fiction, yes, but fiction braided seamlessly with Germany’s troubled modern history. It felt like getting the best of both worlds, history without dryness, literature without pretension.

What struck me most is that people come and go, ideologies rise and collapse, entire eras erase one another, yet the gardener remains. He’s the only constant figure, never fully swept away by History. Nature doesn’t care about regimes or borders. The seasons keep turning, and the gardener keeps working. Sowing, planting, watering. Those small, repetitive acts stitch the chapters together, guiding the reader from one life to the next. Time passes, people vanish, but the soil is still there.

This book kept circling questions I couldn’t shake, what is home, can we ever build something that truly lasts, does constructing a house mean claiming a place in the world.

> “A house is your third skin, after the skin made of flesh and clothes.”


One character, the Architect, reflects on this with chilling clarity, planning homes, planning a homeland. Four walls enclosing a block of air. A house as a “third skin,” after flesh and clothing. And yet even this skin peels away with time.

There’s a deep sense of contingency running through _Visitation_. Panta rhei, everything flows. Everything erodes. Human lives, ambitions, even carefully constructed worlds are temporary at best. Time grinds them down without malice or mercy. Nature alone endures.

We often talk about novels where place becomes character, but _Visitation_ takes that idea seriously. The house by the lake in Brandenburg isn’t just a setting, it’s the novel’s spine. Through it pass generations of residents, visitors, owners, refugees. The house witnesses imperial Germany, the Holocaust, Soviet occupation, East Germany, reunification, roughly 150 years compressed into twelve slim chapters. Most characters remain unnamed, except notably the Jewish ones, whose names carry the weight of being remembered.

> “He used to work in three dimensions, height, width, depth. Now the fourth dimension has caught up with him, time.”


Erpenbeck moves through history with seven-league boots, but never rushes the emotional impact. She doesn’t dramatize catastrophe, she lets it seep in quietly. Domestic scenes, half-glimpsed tragedies, ordinary routines, all subtly marked by the violence of regime change and moral collapse. Her prose is light, almost gossamer, which only makes the brutality beneath it more devastating.

There’s a quiet menace in how she structures the novel. Small details planted early return later with terrible significance. Stories overlap, echo, and entangle, like hidden rooms inside the lake house itself. Nothing is accidental.

The original German title, _Heimsuchung_, carries the idea of both visitation and a haunted search for home, and that melancholy yearning runs through every chapter. Almost everyone in this novel is displaced in one way or another. Homes are lost, bodies are broken, identities erased. Even the house decays alongside them.

> “What had been built to last proves to be no protection at all.”

One line about the Architect stays with me, his profession once dealt in height, width, and depth, but time, the fourth dimension, finally catches up with him and expels him from his own creation.

Erpenbeck knows how to quiet a reader. Her writing doesn’t shout, it hushes. It leaves space for grief, for unease, for reflection. I finished this book stunned by its restraint and its depth.

Honestly, I’m surprised she hasn’t won the Nobel Prize in Literature. If this novel is anything to go by, it feels less like a possibility and more like an inevitability waiting to happen.
