Welcome to my corner of the internet. This is where I write about books, coffee, and whatever else catches my attention.

I don't know from where to start but ye, i read whatever, i do Ui/Ux designs, i animate for fun more like a hobbie.

I share my thoughts on what I've read, not as reviews in the traditional sense, but as conversations with the text.

The books I write about aren't always the newest or most popular. Sometimes they're old friends I'm revisiting. 

Sometimes they're discoveries I stumbled upon. What they all have in common is that they made me think, feel, or see something differently.

When I'm not reading, you'll probably find me with a cup of coffee, thinking about the next book to pick up.

Thanks for stopping by i guess.
